## Bringing the scene to life with motion

1. `Flying Camera` : 
   
   - `W` and `S` for forward and backward, `A` and `D` for left and right and `Q` and `E` for  up and down movement of the camera.
  
2. `Object Translation` :
   
   - `up` , `down` , `left`  , `right`  ,  `I`  , `O` : for object translation 
  
3. `Prism, letâ€™s go for a spin` :
   
   - `R` : To rotate prism around it's own axis
   
4. `Toogle bw Pyramids and Prisms`
   
   - `T` : A toggle functionality switch on
  
**Assumption** : The camera always orients itself to the center of object
